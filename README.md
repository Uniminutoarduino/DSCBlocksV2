Description: 
* DSCBlocks is an application to program DsPICs series 33FJXXXGP/MCXXX from Microchip Inc. through Visual Algorithms (Google Blockly). 

For a quickly glance, see the web version of the app at http://www.seconlearning.com/DSCBlockV2/BlocklyOPt/demos/code/index.html

The application compiles and generates the code for the DSC in the convention of the Microchip XC16 compiler.
The application was tested in JDK version 1.8 and developed in JavaFX.

## Installation

Just create a Netbeans IDE project. Copies the content of the SRC folder inside the classpath of your project. Add the Java libraries LiveGraph (Plotter) and jssc (Serial Port) provided in the full .zip file of the APP available at

## Java Classes explanation:

* GUIController: Main class of the application, opens the different complements as Project Wizard, Plotter, Serial Visualizer, Save and Load.
* Filereaderwriter: Copies the different folders and files needed in the aplication inside the user's folder. 
* Path: Saves the paths for the compiler and user folder.
* Help: Opens the help for the application in the local browser.
* PlayConsole: Opens the plotter and asks the number of variables to plot. This class adjust the elements employed for the class LivePlot.
* Project Wizard: Opens the wizard, asks the route for the user's folder, the DSC (dsPIC 33FJ128GP804 or 33FJ128MC802) and the serial port (COMx) in order to communicate with the development board.
* SerialPortVisual: Opens the serial port Visualizer. 

Each class contains the respective fxml file (scene file) of JavaFX.

## Other files:

session.lgdfs

session.lgdss

session.lggs

Do not remove this files. These files contains the header elements for the plotter LiveGraph!

**The main web page for the application is located in the folder \src\controllyv2\BlocklyOPt\demos\code\index.html**

**Generator for XC16 compiler for the DSCs is located at src\controllyv2\BlocklyOPt\generators\dart\base2.js**

**Blocks (graphical appearance) for the peripherals for the DSC are located at src\controllyv2\BlocklyOPt\blocks\base2.js**

**Libraries for UART, Control and HardwareProfile (macros) for the development board are located in the folder libraries.**

**RTOS (Real Time Operating System) (OSA) is located at the folder OSA.**

**ds30Console for the bootloader is located at the folder src (Do not remove!)**

Any change in the code (generator or blocks) must be reconfigurated in Blockly. To do this, save the file and click the Python Scrip Build.py 
(src\controllyv2\BlocklyOPt\build.py). 
You must have Python version 2.7 or higher.
